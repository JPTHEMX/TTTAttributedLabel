Yes, I saw the email from the lawyers with the H1B extension form. I haven't completed it yet because I received contradictory information where the lawyers are requesting I travel more to be able to recapture time.

My concern is that if we start the extension process now, we won't actually recapture the necessary time they are requesting to qualify for the one-year extension they are seeking.

I suspect there might be a communication gap between the lawyer handling the H1B extension and the one managing my Green Card process (which is also underway). They mentioned that the DOL process for the Green Card takes 14 months on average, which impacts the H1B strategy.

I am drafting an email to the legal team right now to clarify these contradictory points before submitting the form.
